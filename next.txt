TO DO FOR v1.0.0
-look at all update mechanisms in Graph API
	-notifications
	-messages
	-pages
-add unread messages count in context menu
-add event invites count in context menu
-add group invites count in context menu
-add friend-requests count in context menu
-add new settings
	-modifiable-length toasts
	-optional sound
-detect online/offline status
-fix bug where last-check time doesn't reset when user goes offline


WOULD BE NICE
	-theming
	-birthday functionality
	-notification count to dock/system-tray icon
	-write on friends wall
	-send message to friend
	-chat


RELEASE NOTES WILL HIGHLIGHT EVERYTHING
	-1.0.0 release!
	-better notifications (we use Graph API so we don't miss a thing) <- don't know if this is release-notes-worthy :\
		-includes page updates
	-ability to view unread, friend-requests, etc
	-get message notifications in real-time
