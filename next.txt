TO DO FOR v1.0.0
-look at all update mechanisms in Graph API
	-notifications
	(done) messages
	(done) pages
(done) add unread messages count in context menu
(done) add event invites count in context menu
(done) add group invites count in context menu
(done) add friend-requests count in context menu
(done) add click handlers to take to appropriate pages
-add new settings
	-modifiable-length toasts
	-optional sound
-detect online/offline status
-fix bug where last-check time doesn't reset when user goes offline
-fix bug where clicking "check for updates" right after start still shows all the initial updates
-make constants class for things like icon location, facebook url, colors
-create interface and/or parent class for system-icon control classes (one for windows and linux, one for mac - really one for system-tray support and another for dock support)
-create interface for api commands (has execute that takes a call back and possibly pass-through-args, constructor takes args??)
  -maybe constructor can take optional args
  -maybe execute can take optional args, callback, pass-through-args
  -likely execute can take optional args and pass-through-args, but implements an event model instead of callback model
-look at notification engine and see if i can't make a better interface
-look at bugs where notifications don't overlap other notifications, but also the preferences window, error window, etc.
