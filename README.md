# Facebook Desktop

A real-time notification engine for Facebook.

## Overview

Facebook Desktop is a notification engine that gives you updates about your Facebook friends in real-time!  Whenever someone posts a story, comments on your photo, tags you in a status-update, whatever, Facebook Desktop will notify you with a messenger-style toast message.

This project is built with Adobe Flash Builder 4.5 using the Adobe Flex 4.5 SDK and the Adobe AIR 3.0 SDK.  It is cross-platform, capable of running on Windows, Mac, and Linux systems.

This project was first mentioned in my blog post at http://blogs.adobe.com/charles/2011/01/introducing-facebook-desktop-a-lightweight-unobtrusive-notification-engine-for-facebook-built-on-adobe-air.html.
